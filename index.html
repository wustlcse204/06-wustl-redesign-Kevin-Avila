										<img src="alumni.jpg" alt="2017 Awards for Distinction recipients with the Chancellor and Sam Fox School leaders. Photo by Whitney Curtis.">
										<p> The strongest testimony to the value of our education is the success of our alumni. From founding HOK—one of the largest
											architectural firms in the world—to exhibiting work at major museums and galleries throughout the world, to teaching at top
											colleges and universities, our graduates are making a tremendous impact in a diverse range of fields. Our recent Awards for
											Distinction recipients exemplify this level of excellence and breadth of expertise.</p>
										<p>- The work of artist Laylah Ali (MFA94) is meticulous and enigmatic. Drawing on a wide range of sources—including comic strips, hieroglyphs,
												and contemporary and historical events—her distinctive visual language is at once aesthetically disciplined, formally rigorous, and emotionally
												unsettling. Her work has been featured in solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston, the Museum of
												Contemporary Art Chicago, the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, among others.
										</p>
										<p>- In the past 25 years, Yvette Drury Dubinsky (BA64/MA66/MFA90) has had more than 22 solo exhibitions and numerous group shows across the United
												States, Europe, and India. Her work is in several notable collections, including the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Margaret Harwell Museum, the Buhl
												Collection, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and she has participated in the US Department of State’s Art in Embassies program. Much of her
												recent work focuses on migration and is inspired by her travels within the United States and abroad, most recently by her trip to Syria, which she visited
												in 2009.
										</p>
										<p>- Over the course of his 45-year career as an architect, including 20 years as a principal at HOK and AECOM, Christopher Fromboluti (BA67/MArch70) has
												designed, produced, and managed billions of dollars in projects across a variety of sectors, including government, commercial, health care, residential,
												mixed use, and historic preservation. His most recognized work was the reconstruction of the Pentagon after 9/11, for which he served as the lead architect.
										</p>
										<p>- Storytelling has always been at the heart of Alan Griswold's work—both personal and professional. Griswold (BFA96/BA96) is president, founder, and co-owner
											 of Monkey Deux, Inc., an award-winning creative agency and production company based in Los Angeles. Now in its second decade, Monkey Deux continues to build
											 on its highly regarded reputation within the entertainment industry for producing inventive content for theatrical and television marketing, as well as
											 creating original programming, including the short documentary Joe Blaustein and the Flood of Florence.
										</p>
										<p>- Richard Lorch (BA77) is an architect, researcher, author, book series editor, and editor-in-chief of the international research journal Building Research
											 & Information. Over the past four decades, his focus has expanded from the practice of architecture to the wider social impacts of building on energy, climate,
											 and the environment. He leads a worldwide engagement strategy on transitioning to a low-carbon society by coalescing the policy, professional, and academic communities.
										</p>

										<p>- Anisa (Baldwin Metzger) Heming (BS06) is the director of the Center for Green Schools at the US Green Building Council. She began her work with USGBC in New Orleans in
											2008, where she was hired to assist with rebuilding the schools after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Now based in Washington, DC, she provides strategic direction to USGBC's
											 work in schools and coordinates an organization-wide team to promote environmental sustainability, health and wellness, and sustainability literacy in school systems around
											 the world.
										</p>

										<p>- Will Bates (BFA09) is an interaction designer and user experience (UX) lead of infrastructure and data projects for Google's YouTube team in San Bruno, California. As a
											member of the global UX team, his design contributions help YouTube reach a growing audience—the world now watches a billion hours of YouTube content every day. In his
											current role, he oversees a team of designers working to ensure that videos play on any device, at any moment, around the world.</p>
